# Simple Move
The **Simple Move** is a collection of open-source robot motion planning libraries, primarily MoveIt and OMPL. The goal of this project is to perform motion planning for robots in simple obstacle environments, without relying on ROS. This repository provides motion planning libraries that can be embedded into real-time motion programs, making it ideal for small or personal robot projects.

## Installation
To install the IRP libraries, follow these steps:

Clone the IRP repository to your local machine.
